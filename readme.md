This project, comissioned by Hey Freya, is centered on the first major study of Women's Health - the S.W.A.N. study (Study of Women's Health Across the Nation).

Hey Freya is a startup catering to perimenopausal women -- an agegroup that has historically been ignored by healthcare providers. 
Women tend to get medical support during the years they are actively creating families and again during menopause, but in the interim years, many struggle to 
find appropriate care. Hey Freya seeks to target this audience, and sought to investigate data to help them uncover needs and service offerings.

The dataset is a vast collection of 2700 variables, and thus, it was parsed to include variables related to patient outcomes that Hey Freya cares about: 
sleep, nutrition, family status, career, etc.

The project contains feature engineering with the creation of a "Sleep Index;" which is a combination of several sleep related variables. 
On their own, none were predictive, but as an index, there was enough of a reporting population to create a model.

Additionally, the project includes an Excel dashboard with Macros that allow for responsive queries of the sleep index.
